#  Terrace Garden Monitoring System 

An IoT-based smart system for monitoring and managing your terrace garden using the ESP8266. It provides real-time environmental updates including **temperature**, **humidity**, **soil moisture**, **CO‚ÇÇ levels**, and **controls a water pump** based on soil conditions ‚Äî all via a **web dashboard**.

##  Features

-  **Temperature & Humidity** monitoring using **DHT11**
-  **Soil Moisture Detection** to determine wet/dry status
-  **Air Quality Monitoring (CO‚ÇÇ in PPM)** using **MQ135**
-  **Automatic Water Pump Activation** when soil is dry
-  **Live Web Dashboard** accessible over WiFi (hosted by ESP8266)
-  **Responsive and Styled UI** with animations and effects

## IoT Layers
1.	Perception Layer: Sensors collect environmental data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and air quality.
2.	Network Layer: NODEMCU facilitates Wi-Fi-based data transfer to the cloud.
3.	Processing Layer: Data is filtered, calibrated, and formatted on the NODEMCU for reliable cloud transmission.
4.	Application Layer: Web-server, stores, and visualizes the data, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring.


##  Web Interface

Accessible by entering the ESP8266 IP address in a browser after successful Wi-Fi connection.

###  Displayed Info:

-  Temperature (¬∞C)
-  Humidity (%)
-  Soil Condition: `Wet` or `Dry`
-  Water Pump Status: `ON` or `OFF`
-  CO‚ÇÇ Concentration (PPM)

## Wi-Fi Configuration

Update the following lines in your code with your local network credentials:

```cpp

const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";

const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";

Smart Logic

If Soil is Dry ‚Üí Motor turns ON for 5 seconds

If Soil is Wet ‚Üí Motor remains OFF

CO‚ÇÇ is calculated using MQ135 analog input and resistance conversion

Sensor data is read and updated every HTTP request

Sample Output

Connecting to WiFi...

Connected to WiFi!
